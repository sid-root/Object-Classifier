# Object-Classifier
Algorithm to build the yolov3 model is provided in build_model.py

Algorithm to take images and then detect is provided in predict.py

Along with these 2 files, you also need to download the yolov3.weights file (available anywhere online) to get the weights of different layers already found and saved. The weights were calculated by runnning this algorithm on MSCOCO dataset.
